Part I, Data structures: : sequesnce, dicts, sets, Uniclode and data classes
Chapter 1 introduces the Python Data Model 
and explains why the special methods (e.g., __repr__) 
are the key to the consistent behavior of objects of all types.

collection types: sequences, mappings, and sets.
And the str versus bytes split

Best quality of Python is its consistency

object-oriented language Python uses `len(collection)` instead 
of `collection.len()` called Pythonic. 

data model is building blocks of sequences, functions, iterators, coroutines, classes, context managers.

special methods are basic object operations with special syntax
witten with leading and trailing double underscores.

“Dunder” is a shortcut for “double underscore before and after.”

magic method slang for special methods (or dunder methods)
explicitly documented or breakage without warning.

Special methods supporting asynchronous programming

Collection API

Uses f-string syntax instead of `str.format(%)`
